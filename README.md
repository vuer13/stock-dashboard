## Monte Carlo European Option Price
The project implements the Monte Carlo simulation for pricing European-style call and put options. It combines stochastic modeling with statistical inference to estimate option prices, confidence intervals and sensitivity measures. 

### Monte Carlo Simulation
The price of a European option is the expected discounted value of its payoff as expiration. The Monte Carlo method simulates many of potential asset price paths and computes the coresponding payoffs under a risk-neutral measure.

$S_T = S_0 \cdot \exp\left[\left(r - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2\right) T + \sigma \sqrt{T} \cdot Z\right]$

where $Z~N$(0, 1) are standard normal variables. 

Both Anththetic variates and Sobol quasi-random sampling are supported for users to see the variance and convergence.

### Payoff Computation
Call and put payoffs are computed as:
- Call: max($S_T - K$, 0)
- Put: max($K - S_T$, 0)
These were averaged and discounted: Price = $e^{-rT} \cdot$ E[Payoff]

### Implied Volatility
This inverts the BSM formula using Brent's method, solving the implied volatility that matches the observed market price

### Greeks
These values estimate key sensitivities
- Delta: Sensitivity to $S_0$
- Vega: Sensitivity to $\sigma$
